## Pull Request Guidelines
Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
2. If not, then make sure that:

    a. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that follows branch naming guidelines.

    b. You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line).

    c. You have only one commit (if not, squash them into one commit).

    d. Changes done doesn't throw any error. If it does, fix them first and amend your commit (`git commit --amend`).

3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.

    a. Your pull request MUST NOT target the `deployment` branch on this repository. You probably want to target `main` instead or any `epic` or `base-branch` if any from **epic/ user strory**.

    b. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

    c. Provide a description of your changes.

    d. Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes (if such).

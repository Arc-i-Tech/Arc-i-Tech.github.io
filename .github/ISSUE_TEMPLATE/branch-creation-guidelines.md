## Branch creation guidelines.
Please, go through these steps before you start working on any issue.

1. Make sure that you have necessory branch created for issue.
2. If not, then make sure:

    a. Issue/ Task you are working on is independent.

    b. Issue/ Task is just a tiny part of `epic` or `user-story`.

    c. Less than 2 `story-points`.

    d. If any of the above is applicable for `issue`/ task you are working on. Then its optional to create `branch`.
    
    e. You can even consider additional factors such as `merge-conflict` or many people working on same part, or you can concern with `product owner`

3. To create branch,

    a. Follow branch naming convention as follows.
        > `issue-number`-`issue-type`-`short-description`
        - Issue type: is a 1 or 2 char based on issue type as follows:
            * Feature 
            * Bug 
            * Epic
            * User Story

    b. Select base branch.

    c. Commit all changes for this issue in a `branch` which is created for it.

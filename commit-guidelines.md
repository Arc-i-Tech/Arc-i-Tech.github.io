## Commit Guidelines
Please, go through these steps before you commit any changes to your branch.

**Important: Commit only intended changes or files. Do not commit changes for other `tasks`/`issues` to `branch` created for some another `task`/`issue`.** 

1. Make sure your commit has `Title/ Short description`
   - `Title` must be concise and meaningful.
   - Shold not be loger sentensense. 

2. Add `Description` to your commit
   - Detailed information about your commit/ changes.
   - List down what updates you have done. What is the impact of these changes (if any) and is any configuration required for it?

3. If you have a single commit on your branch, then you can put `closes #XXXX` in your commit description. _(It must be the last line)_. And if you think there might be many commits in the future then **don't** put `closes #XXXX`in commit message.

4. After committing changes `push` changes to the server.
